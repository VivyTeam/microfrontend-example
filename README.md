A proof of concept for the Web Portal. Web applications are being wrapped in custom elements and served from a thin integration layer.

## To run a micro frontend app individually

1. To install  the directory which is at the same level as `lerna.json` run `yarn`

2. Navigate to the modules `cd modules` and from there to the app you would like to start. While you are at the same level as `packahe.json` run `yarn dev`   

3. The app runs on your browser at `http://localhost:8080/`
